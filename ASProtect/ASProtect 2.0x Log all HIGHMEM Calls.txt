// Script for OllyScript plugin
/*
////////////////////////////////////////////////// 
it's been a hard time finding all the HIGHMEM calls 'n fixing them
so, i took some time 'n made these scripts. hope it'll be helpfull for
guys with ASProtect. 

1. scripts are for ODBGScript 1.41 version
2. at the beginning of the script source, define the values accordingly, before running the scripts
3. when app is running 'n script has'nt shown SCRIPT FINISHED, abort the script manually

First Script - my_asprotect_HIGHMEM.txt 

this script logs all the highmem calls in log-HIGHMEM-calls.txt
log-HIGHMEM-calls-BIN.txt contains the BYTES in reverse order
for binary pasting in olly.

there's a prob here in log-HIGHMEM-calls-BIN.txt
sometimes addresses like 401204 will get reversed and 
log-HIGHMEM-calls-BIN.txt file will contain corresponding 
41240 not 041240 ... so edit the BIN file manually b4 binary
pasting and put an extra 0 before addresses like 41240
