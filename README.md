OllyDbg is a classic debugger that I'll always have nostalgia for. Maybe it's the memories of late nights, cracking software with friends, the satisfaction with coming up to speed in the field, for what OllyDbg represented as an ideal, and the awesome user base community. Over the years, scripts for unpacking, cracking, and mapping have been developed for most of the packers-including pesky commercial ones like Armadillo. 

This repository contains a number of useful scripts that I had built up over the years.

### Repository Structure

Each folder is a type of packer. Within each folder, you'll find curated unpacking scripts for it.
